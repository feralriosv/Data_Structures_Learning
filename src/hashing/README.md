Recent Structural Improvements:

Class MyHashTable<K, V>

    - Null checks added to insert as well as to find method

    - Remove method implemented

Class HashEntry

    - Setter and getter for next attribute was implemented

Class HashFunction

    - New Implementation, which separates the function logic from the Data Structure as itself

TO-DO
•	Implement the first functional prototype of the MyHashTable (Minimum Viable Product) to test insertions, lookups, and basic collision handling.
•	Do some final adjusts and explore the capacity and loadfactor attributes in MyHashTable class in order to be implemented in the code.
